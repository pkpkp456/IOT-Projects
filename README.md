# Farmer Assistant Bot

Farmer Assistant Bot is an IoT-based solution designed to assist farmers in managing their crops more efficiently. By integrating various sensors, image processing techniques, and machine learning models, this bot helps in monitoring and analyzing the farm environment, ensuring optimal conditions for crop growth.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Collects temperature, humidity, and other environmental data using connected sensors.
- **Image Processing**: Uses an ESP32-CAM module to capture images and process them to detect plant conditions and locate them in the field.
- **Data Storage**: All sensor data and image analyses are stored in a centralized database for easy access and further analysis.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for farmers to visualize data, track plant health, and receive alerts.

## Components

- **Arduino Board**: Acts as the main control unit for the sensors and communication.
- **ESP32-CAM**: Captures images and sends them to the server for processing.
- **Temperature & Humidity Sensors**: Monitor the environmental conditions in real-time.
- **Server**: Handles image processing using OpenCV, stores data, and provides a web interface.

## How It Helps Farmers

- **Efficient Crop Management**: By providing real-time data and insights, farmers can make informed decisions about watering, fertilization, and pest control.
- **Early Detection of Issues**: Image processing helps in early detection of plant diseases, pests, and other issues, allowing for timely intervention.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Historical data and trends help farmers plan better for future crops, optimizing yield and reducing costs.
